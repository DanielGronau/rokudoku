Rokudoku is a number puzzle on hex-fields, similar to Sudoku. The user interface is a little bit crazy, but I hope you like it.

The game is in pre-alpha stage. That means, the core functionality is more or less working, but nothing else, so please don't be disappointed.

### The Rules ###
You have to fill in the missing numbers from 1 to 7. A number must not appear twice in a colored region or in one of the long diagonals (7 cells long, horizontal, top left to bottom right and top right to bottom left).

Hint: I have verified that under these conditions the short diagonals of length five can't contain any duplicate numbers, too.

## The Environment ##
The game requires Java 1.6.0\_10 b12 or better. Transparency in Java isn't supported on all operationg systems, so the game may not work in your environment. Windows XP and better should be fine. Feedback for other systems is welcome.
